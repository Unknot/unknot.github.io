Anyone who has undergone a somewhat formal introduction to probability theory has stumbled upon the triplet $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$$. Those are interpreted as follows: $$\Omega$$ is the sample space that is comprised of all elementary events (or all possible atomic outcomes of a random experiment), $$\mathcal{F}$$ is a $$\sigma$$-algebra (a.k.a. $$\sigma$$-field)
